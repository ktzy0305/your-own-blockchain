# Own Blockchain
Based on "Build your Own Blockchain" by `fireship-io`. A simple blockchain that was coded in TypeScript. There are also wallets, transactions and mining in this program. After coding this, I realised that there are potentially boundless ways to implement this. I might one day implement blockchain in other languages.

## Project Setup
1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository.   
`git clone "repo-url"`
3. Install developer dependencies.  
`npm install`
4. Compile index.ts using TypeScript compiler via a script in package.json  
`npm run dev`
5. Run index.js using node
`node .\index.js`
